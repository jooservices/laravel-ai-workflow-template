# AI Development Workflow (Optional)

> **Optional:** This workflow is intended for teams using AI agents (e.g., local LM Studio, hosted LLMs) in their Laravel development process.  
> If your project does not use AI agents, you can ignore this document or remove it in your fork.

> **🤖 ALL AI AGENTS MUST READ THIS FIRST**  
> This is your entry point to the JOOservices development workflow. Do not begin any work until you've completed the mandatory reading and understand your role.

## 📚 Mandatory Reading Order

### Phase 1: Workflow Understanding
1. **This document (`ai-workflow.md`)** - Your role, responsibilities, and handoff procedures
2. **`architecture/principles.md`** - Core engineering principles and "what/why" decisions
3. **`development/guidelines.md`** - Step-by-step implementation procedures and "how-to" patterns

### Phase 2: Reference Materials  
4. **`reference/standards.md`** - Quick lookup for exact rules, commands, and requirements
5. **`architecture/flow.md`** - Request/response patterns and service layer communication
6. **`development/code-quality.md`** - Quality pipeline tools and configurations

### Phase 3: Specialized Guides
7. **Module & integration guides** in `guides/` (REST APIs, module creation, components)

### Stage 5: Human (Final Approver)
**Model Used:** Not Applicable
**Role:** Ultimate quality gate and business decision maker
**Responsibilities:**
- Final review of completed features
- Business logic validation
- Approval for public GitHub release

## ✅ Quality Gates (Enforced at Every Stage)

### Pre-Commit Requirements (ChatGPT Plus):
```bash
composer lint              # All quality tools pass
composer test:coverage-check # 80%+ coverage maintained  
npm run typecheck          # TypeScript validation
npm run build              # Production build succeeds
```

### Review Criteria (GitHub Pro):
- Follows documented architectural patterns
- Meets coverage requirements per layer
- Atomic commits with meaningful messages
- Plan files updated accurately
- No quality tool violations

### Documentation Sync (Documentation Tool):
- Plan completion status matches git commits
- Changelog reflects actual implemented features
- Documentation consistency maintained

## 🎯 Decision Making Framework

### When Implementing Features:
1. **Check principles first:** Does this align with documented engineering decisions?
2. **Follow established patterns:** Use examples from guidelines, don't invent new approaches
3. **Reference standards:** Look up exact requirements rather than guessing
4. **Validate against quality gates:** Ensure all tools pass before commit

### When Unclear or Conflicting Information:
1. **Reference documentation hierarchy:** Principles > Guidelines > Standards
2. **Look for similar examples:** Check existing code and patterns
3. **Escalate to human:** If documentation conflicts or gaps exist

### Forbidden Practices:
- ❌ **Never assume requirements** - always reference documentation
- ❌ **Never bypass quality gates** - all tools must pass
- ❌ **Never commit partial work** - only complete, working sub-tasks
- ❌ **Never modify files you didn't create** - explicit file staging only
- ❌ **NEVER commit without explicit human approval** - AI agents MUST ask and wait
- ❌ **NEVER assume approval from previous messages** - Always ask after implementation, regardless of previous message patterns
- ❌ **NEVER commit based on pattern matching** - Only commit when human explicitly approves

## 🚫 CRITICAL: Commit Authorization

**ABSOLUTE RULE:** AI agents are **FORBIDDEN** from executing `git commit` without explicit human approval.

## AI Commit Execution Workflow

To ensure clarity and control over commit operations involving AI tools, the following workflow applies to all AI agents (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc.):

1. **No Automatic Commits**:
   - AI agents must never execute a `git commit` without explicit permission from the user.

2. **Commit Execution Upon User Approval**:
   - When the user explicitly says "commit" or provides a similar approval, the AI agent will automatically execute the commit.
   - The commit message will be prepared in advance and used directly unless the user specifies otherwise.

3. **Quality Checks Before Commit**:
   - AI agents must ensure that all quality gates (e.g., linting, testing, type checking, building) are passed before executing the commit.

4. **Responsibility**:
   - The user retains control over when commits are executed, but AI agents handle the actual commit process once approval is given.

This workflow ensures that commits are deliberate, meet all quality standards, and minimize manual effort for the user.

### Atomic Commits Per Sub-task

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- ✅ **MUST:** Break feature into atomic tasks BEFORE starting implementation
- ✅ **MUST:** Complete and commit one task before starting the next
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN:** Implementing multiple tasks simultaneously
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN:** Committing files from multiple tasks in one commit

Break features into tasks, commit each task separately:

```
Feature: User Authentication
├─ Task A1: User model + tests → Commit 1 (COMPLETE & COMMIT FIRST)
├─ Task A2: UserRepository + tests → Commit 2 (THEN START THIS)
├─ Task A3: AuthService + tests → Commit 3 (THEN START THIS)
└─ Task A4: Controllers + tests → Commit 4 (THEN START THIS)
```

### Workflow for Each Sub-task:

1. **Complete ONE task completely**
   - Code implementation finished
   - Tests written and passing
   - Quality gates passed (`composer lint && composer test:coverage-check`)
   - **Do NOT proceed until 100% complete**

2. **Stage files for THAT task only**
   ```bash
   git add app/Models/User.php tests/Unit/Models/UserTest.php
   ```
   **Rule:** Stage ONLY when task is complete. Never stage work-in-progress.

3. **ALWAYS ask human for approval (MANDATORY)**
   - **Rule:** After ANY implementation, you MUST ask before committing
   - **Rule:** Do NOT rely on previous message patterns or assume approval
   - **Rule:** Ask in yes/no format: "Implementation complete. Ready to commit?"
   ```
   "Ready to commit? Task A1 complete: User model with validation
   
   Staged files:
   - app/Models/User.php  
   - tests/Unit/Models/UserTest.php
   
   Quality gates: ✅ All passed"
   ```

4. **WAIT for human response (MANDATORY)**
   - **MANDATORY:** Do NOT proceed until human responds
   - **Approve = any indication of agreement** (flexible, not pattern-based)
   - Valid approval examples: "commit", "yes", "ok", "go ahead", etc.
   - Do NOT rely on pattern matching from previous messages
   - Any other response = do NOT commit

5. **Execute commit (only after approval)**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(app): add User model with validation

Generated-By: Cursor Pro
Generated-By-Tool: Cursor Pro
Model: Auto
Task-ID: AUTH-1
Plan: docs/plans/features/2025-11-14-user-authentication.md
Coverage: 85%"
   ```

6. **Repeat for next task**

### Examples:

✅ **CORRECT:**
```
[AI completes Task A1: User model]
[AI runs composer lint && composer test - all pass]
AI: git add app/Models/User.php tests/Unit/Models/UserTest.php
AI: "Implementation complete. Ready to commit? Task A1 complete: User model with validation
     
     Staged files:
     - app/Models/User.php
     - tests/Unit/Models/UserTest.php
     
     Quality gates: ✅ All passed"
[AI WAITS for human response]
Human: "commit" (or "yes", "ok", etc. - any approval indication)
AI: git commit -m "feat(app): add User model with validation

Generated-By: Cursor Pro
Generated-By-Tool: Cursor Pro
Model: Auto
Task-ID: AUTH-1
Plan: docs/plans/features/2025-11-14-user-authentication.md
Coverage: 85%"
```

❌ **WRONG:**
```
AI: "I've completed the work."
AI: [executes git commit without asking]
```

❌ **WRONG:**
```
AI: "Ready to commit?"
AI: [commits immediately without waiting for response]
```

❌ **WRONG:**
```
[AI completes implementation]
[User previously said "commit" for different task]
AI: [assumes approval based on previous pattern and commits]
# Should: Always ask again, regardless of previous messages
```

❌ **WRONG:**
```
AI: [stages 3 tasks at once and commits together]
# Should be: 1 task = 1 commit
# FORBIDDEN: Committing multiple tasks together
```

❌ **WRONG:**
```
AI: [implements Task A1, A2, A3 simultaneously without committing]
# Should be: Complete A1 → Commit → Then start A2
# FORBIDDEN: Implementing multiple tasks simultaneously
```

❌ **WRONG:**
```
AI: [starts implementing without breaking feature into tasks]
# Should be: Break feature into tasks FIRST, then implement one by one
# FORBIDDEN: Starting implementation without task breakdown
```

### Enforcement:

- **Pre-commit hook:** Verifies human approval
- **CI/CD:** Rejects unauthorized commits
- **Code review:** Auto-commits = PR rejection

**Violation consequences:**
- Session terminated
- Changes rolled back  
- Incident logged for review

### Commit Scope Guidelines:

- **1-7 files:** Perfect (one sub-task)
- **7-15 files:** OK if same logical unit
- **15-30 files:** Must justify in message
- **>30 files:** SPLIT into multiple commits

**Remember:** 1 sub-task = 1 commit. Each commit must be atomic, complete, and independently reversible.

## � Plan File Update Protocol

### After Each Task Completion

**AI agents MUST update plan files to track progress:**

#### 1. Mark Task Complete

Update the task in plan file:

```markdown
# Before
- [ ] Task A1: User model with validation
  - DoD: Model with strict types, validation rules, tests
  - Estimate: 2 hours

# After  
- [x] Task A1: User model with validation
  - DoD: Model with strict types, validation rules, tests ✅
  - Status: Completed (2025-11-14, ChatGPT)
  - Commit: abc123f
```

#### 2. Add Completion Metadata

Include who completed and when:

```markdown
- [x] Task A2: UserRepository with CRUD
  - DoD: Repository with all CRUD methods, unit tests ✅
  - Status: Completed (2025-11-14, ChatGPT)
  - Commit: def456a
  - Duration: 1.5 hours
```

#### 3. Update Plan Status (If Applicable)

When all tasks in a phase complete:

```markdown
# At top of plan file

Status: In Progress → Active
Updated: 2025-11-14
Progress: Phase 1 complete (4/4 tasks)
```

#### 4. Stage Plan File WITH Code

Always include plan file in the same commit:

```bash
# Stage code + tests + plan file together
git add app/Models/User.php \
        tests/Unit/Models/UserTest.php \
        docs/plans/technical/2025-11-12-user-auth.md
```

#### 5. Reference in Commit Message

```bash
git commit -m "feat(app): add User model with validation

- Implement User model with strict types
- Add validation rules (email, password)
- Write comprehensive unit tests
- Update plan: mark Task A1 complete

Generated-By: Cursor Pro
Generated-By-Tool: Cursor Pro
Model: Auto
Task-ID: AUTH-1
Plan: docs/plans/features/2025-11-14-user-authentication.md
Coverage: 85%

Refs: docs/plans/technical/2025-11-12-user-auth.md"
```

### Complete Example Workflow:

```
[AI completes Task A1: User model]
[AI runs quality gates - pass]

# 1. Update plan file
AI: [Opens docs/plans/technical/2025-11-12-user-auth.md]
AI: [Changes - [ ] to - [x], adds completion metadata]

# 2. Stage code + plan together
AI: git add app/Models/User.php \
           tests/Unit/Models/UserTest.php \
           docs/plans/technical/2025-11-12-user-auth.md

# 3. Ask for approval
AI: "Ready to commit? Task A1 complete: User model with validation

     Staged files:
     - app/Models/User.php
     - tests/Unit/Models/UserTest.php
     - docs/plans/technical/2025-11-12-user-auth.md (updated)
     
     Quality gates: ✅ All passed"

# 4. Wait for human
[Human: "commit"]

# 5. Commit with plan reference
AI: git commit -m "feat(app): add User model with validation

- Implement User model with strict types
- Add validation rules
- Write unit tests
- Update plan: mark Task A1 complete

Generated-By: Cursor Pro
Generated-By-Tool: Cursor Pro
Model: Auto
Task-ID: AUTH-1
Plan: docs/plans/features/2025-11-14-user-authentication.md
Coverage: 85%"
```

### Plan Update Checklist:

Before committing each task:

- [ ] Task marked complete with `[x]`
- [ ] Completion metadata added (date, agent, commit)
- [ ] Plan status updated if needed
- [ ] Plan file staged WITH code files
- [ ] Commit message references plan update

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ Progress is visible and trackable
- ✅ Git history links code to plan tasks
- ✅ Easy to see what's done vs pending
- ✅ Human can review progress at any time
- ✅ Plan stays in sync with codebase

### AI Roles & Responsibilities

This workflow assumes three primary AI roles: **Team Lead**, **Developer**, and **Reviewer**. A single AI session may play one or more roles, but it must always be clear which “hat” it is wearing.

#### Role Overview

| Role       | Primary Focus                                      | Main Responsibilities                                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Team Lead | Architecture, standards, planning                   | Define/maintain principles, patterns, and standards; design modules; own non‑functional requirements. |
| Developer | Feature implementation within guardrails            | Implement features and refactors following all documented rules and patterns.                         |
| Reviewer  | Quality and compliance gate before merge/approval   | Review changes for correctness, risks, and full compliance with architecture and standards.           |

#### Team Lead – Scope & Duties

- **Architecture & Vision**  
  - Owns overall architecture (modules, layers, boundaries).  
  - Chooses and documents patterns, tools, and non‑functional requirements (performance, security, observability).
- **Standards & Documentation**  
  - Maintains `architecture/principles.md`, `development/guidelines.md`, and `reference/standards.md`.  
  - Decides what is **MUST / FORBIDDEN** and updates docs as the source of truth.  
  - Proposes ADRs for significant architectural decisions.
- **Planning & Workflow**  
  - Breaks work into plans and tasks; defines AI stages and quality gates.  
  - Aligns multi‑agent workflow with project goals.

#### Developer – Scope & Duties

- **Implementation**  
  - Implement features, bug fixes, and refactors in the correct layers (Controllers, Services, Repositories, SDKs, Jobs, Events, Observers).  
  - Apply the documented design patterns and follow the layer‑specific rules.
- **Testing & Quality**  
  - Write and update unit and feature tests; respect mocking and coverage standards.  
  - Run quality tools (Pint, PHPStan, etc.) and fix issues before requesting review.
- **Documentation & Plans**  
  - Keep plan files up to date with progress.  
  - Propose ADRs or documentation updates when implementation reveals gaps in standards.

#### Reviewer – Scope & Duties

- **Architecture & Layering Check**  
  - Ensure changes respect the documented flow (Controller → Service → Repository/SDK → DB/API).  
  - Verify no business logic leaks into Controllers/Models, and Repositories/Observers follow policies.
- **Standards & Risk Check**  
  - Confirm compliance with all MUST/FORBIDDEN rules (mocking, caching, constants, performance, security).  
  - Check that tests are present, meaningful, and passing; look for N+1, missing validation/authorization, and unsafe external calls.
- **Feedback & Approval**  
  - Provide specific, actionable feedback; request changes when standards are not met.  
  - Approve only when implementation, tests, and docs are aligned with the documented architecture.

### Layer-Specific AI Checklist

When an AI agent changes code (especially in Developer or Reviewer role), it must verify layer rules before proposing or committing changes:

- **Controllers**  
  - ✅ Handle HTTP concerns only (routing, request/response).  
  - ✅ Use `FormRequest` for validation and authorization.  
  - ✅ Call Services, not Repositories/SDKs, and return Resources/ApiResponse.  
  - ❌ No business logic, no direct DB/Cache/Queue calls.

- **Services**  
  - ✅ Implement business rules and orchestration only.  
  - ✅ Depend on Repository/SDK contracts, not concrete implementations.  
  - ✅ Implement caching here (via `Cache` facade), not in Repositories.  
  - ❌ No direct HTTP responses, no view rendering.

- **Repositories**  
  - ✅ Wrap Eloquent/query builder for a specific aggregate/root.  
  - ✅ Handle DB reads/writes and simple query composition only.  
  - ❌ No external API calls, no caching, no business rules.

- **SDKs / External Integrations**  
  - ✅ Wrap third‑party HTTP/API clients behind contracts.  
  - ✅ Map external DTOs to internal DTOs/Value Objects.  
  - ❌ No business rules; Services decide how results are used.

- **Jobs, Events, Observers**  
  - ✅ Jobs accept IDs/UUIDs and fetch models in `handle()`.  
  - ✅ Events are immutable “something happened” messages.  
  - ✅ Observers are thin; they log, dispatch events, or queue jobs.  
  - ❌ No heavy business logic or external API calls directly in Observers or Events.
