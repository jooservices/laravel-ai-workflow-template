# Documentation Directory Structure Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the purpose and organization of each directory within the documentation root, following the **Principle → Guideline → Standard** hierarchy.

> **When used as a Git submodule:**  
> In a consuming Laravel project, this repository is typically mounted under `<project-root>/docs/`. In that setup, the root of this repo **is** the `docs/` folder for your project.
