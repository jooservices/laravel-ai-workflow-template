| **P4 - Future** | Exploratory, long-term vision | Revisit quarterly |

## Writing Guidelines

### Summary Section
- **Be concise**: 2-3 sentences maximum
- **Answer "why"**: Explain business value or problem solved
- **Include scope**: What's explicitly included/excluded, phase boundaries

**Example:**
```markdown
## Summary
Enable content creators to generate AI‑powered article outlines, introductions, 
and meta descriptions directly in the blog post editor. All AI operations 
use approved models with mandatory manual review before publishing.

**Scope:** Phase 1 - Core content generation only (outline, intro, meta). 
Phase 2 will include fact-checking and summaries.
```

### Dependencies Section
- **List prerequisites**: What must exist before work can start
- **External blockers**: Third-party systems, approvals, infrastructure
- **Internal dependencies**: Other features, modules, or services

**Example:**
```markdown
## Dependencies
- AI model runtime available in development/production
- External content API authentication configured
- Action logging infrastructure (`ActionLogger`)
- DevOps approval for production deployment
```

### Objectives Section
- **Make them measurable**: Use numbers, percentages, or specific outcomes
- **Focus on impact**: What changes for users or the business
- **Limit to 3-5 items**: Too many objectives = unclear scope

**Good objectives:**
- ✅ Reduce post creation time by 30% for editors
- ✅ Achieve 80% test coverage on all AI service endpoints
- ✅ Support 5 content generation templates (outline, intro, conclusion, meta, summary)

**Bad objectives:**
- ❌ Make the system better
- ❌ Improve performance
- ❌ Add AI features

### Tasks Section
- **Start with verb**: "Create", "Implement", "Update", "Test"
- **One task = one pull request**: If task is too big, split it
- **Include DoD (Definition of Done)**: Specific, testable criteria
- **Add time estimates**: For sprint planning and capacity management
- **Order by dependency**: Blocked tasks go last
- **Check off when complete**: Update with `[x]` when done
- **Calculate total effort**: Sum estimates for project planning

**Task structure:**
```markdown
- [ ] Create CategoryService for business logic
  - DoD: Service implements all CRUD methods (list, create, update, delete)
  - DoD: 95% test coverage with unit + feature tests
  - DoD: Audit logging added for all mutations
  - DoD: PHPStan passes at maximum level
  - Estimated: 6 hours

**Total Estimated Effort:** 87 hours (~2-3 weeks for 1 developer)
```

**Definition of Done (DoD) Guidelines:**
- Code quality: "Passes `composer lint` pipeline"
- Testing: "80% coverage with passing tests"
- Documentation: "API endpoints documented in guide"
- Integration: "Works with existing external content SDK"
- Performance: "Response time < 200ms for list operations"
- Security: "FormRequest validation for all inputs"

### Success Metrics Section
- **Make them quantifiable**: Numbers, percentages, time thresholds
- **Use categories**: Performance, Adoption, Quality, Reliability, Security
- **Set realistic targets**: Based on baseline or industry standards
- **Include measurement method**: How will you verify the metric

**Example:**
```markdown
## Success Metrics
- **Performance:** AI generation completes in < 10 seconds for 95% of requests
- **Adoption:** 50% of content editors try AI features within first month
- **Quality:** 80% of generated content accepted with minor edits
- **Reliability:** 99% uptime for AI service endpoints
- **Security:** Zero instances of sensitive data leakage in prompts
```

### Risks & Mitigations Section
- **Identify potential problems**: Technical, resource, timeline, quality
- **Assess impact**: What happens if this risk materializes
- **Estimate probability**: How likely is this to occur
- **Define mitigation**: Concrete actions to prevent or handle the risk

**Example:**
```markdown
## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Ollama performance issues | High | Medium | Load test early, implement request queuing |
| Poor content quality | Medium | High | Extensive prompt engineering, user feedback loop |
| Resource exhaustion | High | Low | Rate limiting, request timeouts, monitoring |
| User distrust of AI | Medium | Medium | Clear labeling, manual review required |
```

### Related Plans Section
- **Link dependencies**: Plans that must complete first
- **Link integration points**: Plans that share systems or features
- **Link epic siblings**: Other plans in same feature group
- **Note future phases**: Work that will continue in separate plans

**Example:**
```markdown
## Related Plans
- `docs/features/content/posts-management.md` - Post editor integration point
- `docs/technical/caching-strategy.md` - May cache AI responses for similar prompts
- Phase 2: Fact-checking expansion (separate plan TBD)
```

### Notes Section
Use for:
- **Technical constraints**: "Must use local models only" (if applicable)
- **Dependencies**: "Blocked by external content API authentication (#42)"
- **Risks**: "High memory usage if processing large posts"
- **Future work**: "Consider adding translation support in v2"
- **Related docs**: "See `docs/architecture/flow.md` for service layer pattern"

## Workflow

### 1. Creating a New Plan
```bash
# Create plan file in appropriate directory
touch docs/features/wordpress/my-feature.md
# or
touch docs/technical/performance-optimization.md
```

**File naming:**
- Use descriptive kebab-case: `media-management.md`, `api-caching.md`
- No date prefixes (git history tracks creation date)
- Group by domain: `features/wordpress/`, `technical/`, `features/ai/`

### 2. During Implementation
- **Update status** as work progresses: Draft → Ready → Active → Review → Completed
- **Check off tasks** when DoD criteria are met: `- [x] Task completed`
- **Update "Updated" date** when making significant changes
- **Add notes** for blockers or scope changes

### 3. Completing a Plan
When all tasks are checked:
1. Update status to **Completed**
2. Update "Updated" date
3. Create retrospective if significant learnings: `docs/retrospectives/feature-name.md`
4. Move plan to archive if desired (optional): `docs/archive/features/`

## Examples

### Good Plan - Clear and Actionable
```markdown
# Plan – WordPress Post Scheduling

Status: Active  
Priority: P1  
Owner: Viet Vu <jooservices@gmail.com>  
Created: 2025-11-13  
Updated: 2025-11-13  
Target: 2025-11-30  
Epic: WordPress Features

## Summary
Enable content editors to schedule WordPress posts for future publication 
directly from the JOOservices platform. Eliminates manual publishing 
coordination and reduces missed publication deadlines.

**Scope:** Single post scheduling only. Bulk scheduling and recurring 
schedules are out of scope for Phase 1.

## Dependencies
- WordPress SDK with authentication (completed)
- Laravel queue worker running in production
- Database migration for scheduled_posts table

## Objectives
- Support scheduling up to 30 days in advance
- Achieve 99.9% on-time publication accuracy
- Reduce manual publish operations by 80%

## Tasks
- [x] Add scheduled_posts table migration
  - DoD: Columns: post_id, publish_at, status, retry_count
  - DoD: Indexes on publish_at and status
  - DoD: Foreign key to wp_posts (if stored locally)
  - Estimated: 2 hours
- [ ] Create ScheduledPostService with queue integration
  - DoD: Implements schedule(), reschedule(), cancel() methods
  - DoD: 90% test coverage with edge case handling
  - DoD: Uses Laravel queue for reliable execution
  - Estimated: 8 hours
- [ ] Add schedule UI to post editor
  - DoD: Date/time picker with timezone support
  - DoD: Shows scheduled posts in separate tab
  - DoD: Allows rescheduling and cancellation
  - Estimated: 10 hours
- [ ] Implement queue job for publishing
  - DoD: Retries 3 times on failure with exponential backoff
  - DoD: Sends notification on success/failure
  - DoD: Updates post status in local database
  - Estimated: 6 hours

**Total Estimated Effort:** 26 hours (~1 week for 1 developer)

## Success Metrics
- **Reliability:** 99.9% of scheduled posts publish within 1 minute of target time
- **Adoption:** 30% of posts use scheduling within first 2 weeks
- **Error Rate:** < 0.1% failed publications requiring manual intervention

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Queue worker downtime | High | Low | Implement health checks, alerting, auto-restart |
| Timezone confusion | Medium | High | Store UTC, display user TZ, prominent TZ indicator in UI |
| WordPress API throttling | Medium | Low | Rate limiting, retry with backoff, queue spreading |

## Related Plans
- `docs/features/wordpress/posts-management.md` - Post editor integration
- Phase 2: Bulk scheduling and recurring posts (Q1 2026)

## Notes
- Uses Laravel queue system - ensure queue worker is running
- Timezone handling: Store in UTC, display in user's timezone
- Consider future enhancement: Recurring schedules (weekly series)
```

### Bad Plan - Vague and Incomplete
