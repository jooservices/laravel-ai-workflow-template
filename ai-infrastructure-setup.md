# AI-Augmented Dev Workflow 2025 — Hybrid Local Architecture

**Executive summary**

This document describes a professional, zero-token AI development workflow designed for developers and teams who want enterprise-grade reasoning and high developer velocity without sending production code to cloud LLMs. The architecture combines:

- A **MacBook Pro** as the primary development workstation (IDE, debugging, orchestration).
- A **local GPU workstation** (RTX 4070 Ti Super) running **Ollama** with models such as **DeepSeek Coder V2** and **Mixtral 8x7B** for heavy reasoning.
- Subscription flat-rate AI tools for writing and research (ChatGPT Plus, Copilot, Cursor) — no token billing.

**Core objectives**

- Zero token-based billing: use subscription tiers and local AI models.
- Keep code private: inference happens on your hardware by default.
- Fast iteration: GPU-backed local inference for deep analysis; light models on Mac for mobile.

---

## Hardware & software stack

**Primary development machine (mobile):**
- MacBook Pro 16" (M3 Pro, 36GB RAM)
- IDEs: PHPStorm (primary for PHP), Cursor Pro (for JS/Vue), VS Code
- Plugins: GitHub Copilot, Continue.dev (extension), local Ollama client

**AI compute server (home/workstation):**
- Workstation: Intel i9 / 128GB RAM / RTX 4070 Ti Super (16GB VRAM)
- Software: Ollama server, optional OpenWebUI for model management
- Models: DeepSeek Coder V2, Mixtral 8x7B (GPU-accelerated)

**Web tools (support layer):**
- ChatGPT Plus (GPT-4o) — writing, documentation, brainstorming (web)
- Claude (Free or Pro) — diff review, logic checking (web/app)
- Gemini Pro / SuperGrok — research and real-time lookup (web)

---

## Workflow (step-by-step)

### 1. Planning & architecture (Web)
- Use **ChatGPT Plus** to draft architecture diagrams, feature outlines, and written plans.
- Use **Claude** for a second opinion, focusing on logical correctness and edge cases.
- Provide web AI with a compact **context-summary.md** (generated locally) — never paste the entire repository.

### 2. Coding (IDE)
- Write backend code in **PHPStorm** with **Copilot** assisting for inline completions and test stubs.
- Use **Cursor Pro** for frontend (Vue/Node) development with GPT-4o inline chat.
- For quick edits or single-file refactors, use Cursor or Copilot.

### 3. Refactor / full-repo reasoning (Local)
- Use **VS Code + Continue.dev** configured to connect to your **Ollama** server on the workstation.
- Run tasks like "List all usages of service X", "Generate integration tests for module Y", or "Suggest a safe refactor plan".
- Ollama on GPU handles multi-file analysis privately and fast.

### 4. Testing & Debug
- Generate unit tests with Copilot or Ollama.
- Run PHPUnit, Jest, or Vitest locally; use PHPStorm for step-debugging (Xdebug).
- If tests fail, collect stack traces and send minimal context to Ollama for root-cause analysis.

### 5. Review & release
- For small PRs/diffs, use **Claude** (web/app) to get a human-friendly review and risk list.
- Use **ChatGPT** for polished release notes and changelogs.
- Keep pre-commit hooks for ESLint, PHP CS Fixer, and SonarLint.

### 6. Research & updates
- Use **Gemini Pro** / **SuperGrok** to search docs, libraries, and community fixes.

## Models & placement strategy

- **Workstation (GPU):** DeepSeek Coder V2, Mixtral 8x7B — heavy reasoning, refactors, test generation.
- **Mac (mobile/CPU):** Phi-3 Mini, Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B — offline reasoning, code explanation, small refactors.

**Switching behavior**
- When workstation is reachable on LAN, VS Code/Continue should use the workstation Ollama server.
- When mobile (no LAN), Mac uses a local lightweight model to remain productive.

---

## Cost & maintenance

**Monthly (fixed):**
- ChatGPT Plus: $20
- GitHub Copilot Pro: $10
- Cursor Pro: $20
**Total:** ~$50/month (fixed) — no token billing.

**One-time hardware (example, already owned):**
- MacBook Pro M3 Pro
- Workstation with RTX 4070 Ti

**Maintenance**
- Update Ollama and models occasionally.
- Monitor disk usage (models can take tens of GB).
- Keep backups of critical configs.

---

## Why this approach?

- **Privacy-first** — code stays on local machines unless you explicitly share it.
- **Predictable cost** — subscription flat fees, no token surprises.
- **Performance** — GPU-backed local inference for heavy tasks; CPU/mobile models for on-the-go work.
- **Flexible & extendable** — add larger models or more GPUs as needed.

### Export / publishing
- Use the provided Markdown for WordPress or LinkedIn.
- Use the HTML for offline presentation; LANG toggle switches EN/VN.
